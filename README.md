## Business Strategy: <a name="payment-strategy">Payment</a>

The service uses a one-time payment strategy. During the deployment setup process, you will need to provide your Monero wallet address and set the service price. After clients register, they will configure their page by specifying details such as name and unique URL path. Once the service price is paid, their page is now public, and they can share their page links with their audience to receive tips.

## <a name="install-and-build">Install & Build üõ†Ô∏è</a>

### <a name="traefik">1. Traefik</a>

First of all you must create network that containers communicate over it.

```console
docker network create traefik
```

then setup the env

```console
cd traefik
cp .env.example .env
```

Now change the .env with yours and run the container.

> [!WARNING]  
> The **password** must be **Hashed** in the env and also if you add that in compose file the "$" characters must be doubled to not recognized as variable by docker engine.

```console
docker compose up
```

### <a name="monero">2. Monero</a>

You can use Make file by below command in Monero directory to get and config Monero related repositories.

```console
cp monero
make monero-setup
```

or:

```console
cp monero
git clone https://github.com/monero-project/monero.git
git clone https://github.com/vtnerd/monero-lws/tree/release-v0.3_0.18
cp Dockerfile.monero ./monero/Dockerfile
cp Dockerfile.lws ./monero-lws/Dockerfile
```

Run the container :

```console
docker compose up -d
```

Because the Monero daemon must sync with the network, it may take a long time. You can monitor this process by checking the logs:

```console
docker compose logs -f
```

After it is synced and ready, go next.
